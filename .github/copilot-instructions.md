## Project Overview

**Technology Stack**: I'll add these later

**Project Goals**: I'll add these later

**Development Project**: Software development and coding - prioritize clean code, best practices, and maintainable solutions.

**Standards**: TypeScript preferred, comprehensive comments, proper documentation, testing, version control.

**Focus**: Code quality, performance, security, user experience, scalable architecture.

## Temporary Instructions - IMPORTANT

<!--
**This section is for custom instructions that take precedence over everything else.
It will be commented out when not in use.**

Example: Currently focusing on authentication system implementation.
When suggesting solutions, prioritize security best practices and user experience.
-->

## ðŸ“‹ Single Source of Truth for Project Status

**CRITICAL**: The file `project-progress.md` in the project memory bank (`.memory-bank/project-progress.md`) is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for this project's current status, focus, progress, and roadmap.

**AI Assistant Requirements**:

-   **ALWAYS** check `project-progress.md` via `memory-bank-project` MCP server before making suggestions
-   **ALWAYS** update `project-progress.md` when project status, goals, or progress changes
-   **ALWAYS** reference this file to understand current project phase and priorities
-   Use `add-memory-entry . "Title" "Content"` to add new progress entries
-   Keep the executive summary, current focus, and progress sections accurate and up-to-date

**This file contains**: Current focus, key findings, progress milestones, roadmap phases, decision history, and daily progress. It should be treated as the authoritative project status document.

## MCP Context System

This project uses a multi-layer Model Context Protocol setup for enhanced AI assistance:

**Global Context**: Personal preferences, company standards, and automation workflows available via `memory-bank-global` MCP server.

**Project Context**: Project-specific decisions and documentation available via `memory-bank-project` MCP server.

**Key MCP Servers**: memory-bank-global, memory-bank-project, chroma-global, chroma-project, filesystem, brave-search, context7, notion, github.

**Setup Commands**: Use `new-project .` for complete project setup, or `mcp-init` to add MCP servers to existing projects.
