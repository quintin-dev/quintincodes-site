# Refactoring Assistant

Analyze the selected code and suggest improvements:

## Refactoring Goals
- **Extract Functions**: Break down complex functions
- **Remove Duplication**: Identify and eliminate code duplication
- **Improve Naming**: Suggest better variable/function names
- **Simplify Logic**: Reduce cognitive complexity
- **Performance**: Optimize for better performance
- **Maintainability**: Make code easier to maintain

## Analysis Areas
1. **Function Length**: Are functions too long?
2. **Parameter Count**: Too many parameters?
3. **Nested Conditions**: Can we reduce nesting?
4. **Magic Numbers**: Should we extract constants?
5. **Design Patterns**: Would patterns help?

## Deliverables
- Refactored code with explanations
- Before/after comparison
- Performance impact analysis
- Maintainability improvements
- Breaking change assessment

Ensure refactoring maintains existing functionality and includes updated tests.
