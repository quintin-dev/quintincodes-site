# TypeScript & JavaScript Standards

## Code Quality
- Always use explicit return types for functions
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes  
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for components and classes
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for file names

## Best Practices  
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch
- Use async/await over .then() for promises
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write self-documenting code with descriptive names

## React Specific (if applicable)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop validation
- Follow the composition pattern
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization
